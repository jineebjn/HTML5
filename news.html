				<p>When working with dynamic content that includes a footer, a problem sometimes occurs where the content on a page is not enough to fill it. The footer, rather than staying at the bottom of the page where we would want it to stay, rises up and leaves a blank space beneath it.

If the content grows larger than the viewport, the footer will remain ‘stuck’ to the bottom of the viewport, whether we want it to or not.When working with dynamic content that includes a footer, a problem sometimes occurs where the content on a page is not enough to fill it.
